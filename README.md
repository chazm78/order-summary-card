### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have tinkered a bit over the years with CSS. This is my first real attempt at coding anything. So everything I have done on this challenge has been a learning adventure. I have a pretty dialed in schedule set aside to learning Frontend. I have been bouncing between the app called Mimo and the obvious freecodecamp.  

### Continued development

There is more than one way to build something. I know my code is messy or at least that's how I feel. The more I practice building things the better I get. I'd like to get better at laying things out in a more structured way.
